# To-Do List (Task App)

We will develop a To-Do list web app (Task App) using React JS and Tailwind CSS. This React To-Do app will feature an input field for users to add tasks. The added tasks will be displayed in a list.

When a user clicks on a task in the list, it will be marked as completed or incomplete. Users will also have the option to delete to-do items using a delete icon (bin icon).

The To-Do Task list will be saved in the browser, allowing users to access their saved list when they reopen the browser. We will be using Tailwind CSS to design this React App.
